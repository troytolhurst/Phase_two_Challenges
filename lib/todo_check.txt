Design sheet: 
Problem: 
As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to check if a text includes the string #TODO.
function signature: 
takes a string most likely tasks some include the #TODO
return a bool for now but may change this to an f-string with the task: 
any additional features: N/A
