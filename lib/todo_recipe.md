design two classes that help complete to do lists: 

class one: 
todo list: 
main functions: 
add : creates and instance of todo and adds the todo to the list of things to do
incomplete: return a list of todo instances:
complete: return a list of incomplete todos
give up: mark all todo complete because you gave up

class two:
instantuate:
takes a string representing a task
side effects: 
sets task property
sets the complete property to false

mark_complete:
returns nothing 
sets the complete property to True
